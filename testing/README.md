# Testing

To run a test on the dynamics use ```test_dynamics.py``` and use ```-data``` as the flag for the input data. Script will produce a graph of dynamics. Check the paremeters folder for a description of the different test scenarios

```
python test_dynamics.py -data test5.yaml
```

To run a test on rho use ```test_rho.py``` and use ```-data``` as the flag for the input data. Script will produce a graph of many paths of rho, along with its proper bounds

```python test_rho.py -data test5.yaml```
